# Welcome to My Levenshtein
***

## Task
write an algorithm that calculates the Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number between two words.

## Description
The Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number is simple: it's a value that represents how similar two given strings are.
It is found by comparing two strings and returning the difference between them. (For information, the Levenshtein number is a real concept but we've simplified it a bit for the purposes of this exercise.)


## Instructions
Your function must take in 2 strings with the exact number of characters and return an integer representing the difference between them.

If your parameters are not the same size then your function will return -1.

If the two strings are the same size, you must then iterate through each string and determine which characters are different. Each time there is a difference, it counts as 1.
