## Task
TODO - What is the problem? And where is the challenge?

## Description
- <strong>ex00:</strong> Create a function my_range which returns a malloc'd array of integers. This integer array should contain all values between min and max.
Min included - max excluded.
- <strong>ex01:</strong> Let's allocate a string (or array of characters).
We have this: "abc" and we want a copy in a new part of memory that you will have to malloc.
(Reproduce the behavior of strdup from man strdup)

One word per line. Each word will be followed by a newline, including the last one.
- <strong>ex03:</strong> Create a function my_count_on_it, which receives a string array as parameter and returns an array with the length of each strings.
- <strong>ex04:</strong> Create a function that join an array of strings on a separator characters.
- <strong>ex05:</strong> create a function that takes in a flight path of a rocket ship as a string of letters and returns the following format:
