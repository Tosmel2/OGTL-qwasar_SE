## Task
Pointers!!

In our life as developer there is a before and after in our life with pointers :D
There is no better way to learn pointers... than doing it.

What is a pointer?

A variable which contain the address of another variable.
^o)
Let dive... in?

Objective of this quest is to discover pointers and starting to have some experience with pointers.
We will also do some loop. :)

## Description
- <strong>ex00:</strong> Create a function that takes a pointer to integer as a parameter, and sets the value to 0.
- <strong>ex01:</strong> Let's switch the content of parameter A and parameter B. :-)

Create a function that swaps the value of two integers whose addresses are entered as parameters.
- <strong>ex02:</strong> Reproduce the behavior of the function strlen.
The strlen() function computes the length of the string s.

The strlen() function returns the number of characters.
- <strong>ex03:</strong> Create a function that displays a string of characters on the standard output.
The address of the string's first character is in the pointer entered as
parameter in the function.
- <strong>ex04:</strong> Create a my_add function which takes 2 parameters (nbr1 and nbr2) and returns a value. This value is the result of the addition of nbr1 and nbr2 parameters.
- <strong>ex05:</strong> Create a my_sub function which takes 2 parameters (nbr1 and nbr2) and returns a value. This value is the result of the subtraction of nbr1 and nbr2 parameters.
- <strong>ex06:</strong> Create a my_mult function which takes 2 parameters (nbr1 and nbr2) and returns a value. This value is the result of the multiplication of nbr1 and nbr2 parameters.
- <strong>ex07:</strong> Create a my_string_formatting function which takes 3 parameters (firstname, lastname and age) and prints a string composed value.
Formatting should be: "Hello, my name is FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, I'm AGE."
- <strong>ex08:</strong> Create a my_string_index function which takes 2 parameters (haystack and needle) and locates the first occurrence of the character needle in the string haystack and returns the position.
You can this function as: is there a L (character) in my string "helLo".

Objective is to build a loop and having a if statement when it matches the right character and returns its position.
- <strong>ex09:</strong> Create a my_upcase function. Which takes a string as parameter and returns the uppercase version of it.
- <strong>ex10:</strong> Create a my_downcase function. Which takes a string as parameter and returns the lowercase version of it.
