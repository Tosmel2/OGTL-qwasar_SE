## Task
We will proceed to rebuild some of the C library function to understand how they work.

Objective:
More pointers, more loops, more string and a beginning of struct. :-)

Complexity will be one loop with multiple variables.
strstr is specially you will touch the one loop with one nested loop. :-)

Last notion is struct, it's a big box of variables :-)

## Description
- <strong>ex00:</strong> a program that takes a string as argument returns its reverses.
- <strong>ex01:</strong> The strcmp() function compares string1 with string2 to see if there are equals.
- <strong>ex02:</strong> The strcpy() and strncpy() functions copy the string source (src) to destination (dst).
- <strong>ex03:</strong> Reproduce the behavior of the function strncpy.
- <strong>ex04:</strong> Searches for the first occurrence of the character c (an unsigned char) in the string pointed to by the argument str. The terminating null character is considered to be part of the string. Returns a pointer pointing to the last matching character, or null if no match was found.
- <strong>ex05:</strong> Searches for the last occurrence of the character c (an unsigned char) in the string pointed to by the argument str. The terminating null character is considered to be part of the string. Returns a pointer pointing to the last matching character, or null if no match was found.
- <strong>ex06:</strong> Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or NULL if needle is not part of haystack.
- <strong>ex07:</strong> receive a struct integer_array.
You have to print its size and its content following this format: size\narray[0]\narray[1]...
Iterate throught the variable size to iterate throught the struct.
- <strong>ex08:</strong> a function that takes an integer array as a parameter (input) and returns a boolean (true/false).
